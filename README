This project provides a Java implementation of the Weechat Relay Protocol

weechat - An eclipse project to build the Android sample application(May require modifying the library path to include weechat-relay.jar from weechat-relay)
weechat-relay - A library implementing the Weechat Relay Protocol
weechat-relay-example - A simple example program that makes use of the weechat-relay library

You can build these projects by running 'ant' from this directory. If you wish to build them individually, you must build weechat-relay(the library) first.

To build the android application, you will need to 'cd weechat', then run 'android update project --path .' before running ant.
