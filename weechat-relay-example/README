This is a simple demo program showing how to connect to a Weechat Relay server, send it messages, and hook responses from it.

This will gain more documentation and possibly testcases in the future.

Compile the sample weechat-relay-example.jar using ant.  You must have previously built the library in ../weechat-relay
